-- Interviews service schema.
--
-- This service owns the interview loop: which rounds are booked against an
-- application, who sits on the panel, and what each interviewer concluded. The
-- application, the job and the candidate belong to other services; what is kept
-- here is the round itself plus the two snapshot fields a schedule view needs,
-- so rendering a week of interviews does not fan out one call per row.

-- `format` is an enum rather than free text because the meeting link is only
-- meaningful for one of the values, and a typo'd "vidoe" would silently produce
-- a round nobody can join.
CREATE TYPE interview_format AS ENUM ('onsite', 'video', 'phone');

-- `no_show` is a distinct status rather than a flavour of cancelled: cancelling
-- is the company's decision and reflects on nobody, while a no-show is a fact
-- about the candidate that reporting has to be able to count separately.
