// Package team is the company-facing surface over a tenant's own people and
// roles.
//
// It exists because the roster and the role set are identity's data, and the
// only way to reach them used to be `/internal/companies/{id}/members` — a
// route guarded by the service-to-service secret and deliberately not routed by
// the gateway. A customer could therefore not manage their own team at all.
//
// The rules that decide who may change whose access live in guards.go as pure
// functions over permission lists, so they can be tested exhaustively without a
// database and so a reader can see the whole authorization model on one screen.
