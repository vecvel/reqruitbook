-- Jobs service schema.
--
-- The jobs service owns *what a company is hiring for and where that opening is
-- visible*. It holds no accounts, no applications and no company profile; the
-- only foreign identifier it stores is company_id, minted by the companies
-- service, and it carries no foreign key because the two live in separate
-- databases.
