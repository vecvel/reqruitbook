/**
 * The two guarantees the read model rests on, proved against a real Postgres.
 *
 * They live in SQL — an `ON CONFLICT ... WHERE EXCLUDED.occurred_at >= ...`
 * predicate and a primary-key collision — so a mocked repository cannot prove
 * either one. What is checked here is exactly what the database does:
 *
 *   1. An event older than the row it would update changes nothing. Delivery is
 *      out of order, and a suspension redelivered after a reinstatement must not
 *      suspend the tenant again.
 *   2. The same event applied twice has the effect of applying it once.
 *
 * Skips cleanly without TEST_DATABASE_URL so `pnpm test` is green with no
 * database. Point it at a scratch database:
 *
 *   TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://reqruitbook:reqruitbook@localhost:5432/admin \
 *     pnpm --filter @reqruitbook/admin test
