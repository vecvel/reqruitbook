-- Admin console read model.
--
-- This service owns nothing. Every table below is a *projection* of a fact
-- another service published, kept here so the console can answer "how is the
-- platform doing?" without fanning out to ten services on every page load.
--
-- Two consequences follow, and they shape every table:
--
--   1. Nothing here is a source of truth. A row is stale by definition — it is
--      as current as the last event delivered. Never write back to it from a
--      console action; publish to the owning service instead.
--   2. Delivery is at-least-once and out-of-order. Every state table therefore
--      carries `occurred_at`, the timestamp of the newest event applied to it,
--      and an upsert only lands when the incoming event is at least that new.
--      `activity.event_id` is the second half of the story: it is the
--      de-duplication gate every consumer passes through, which is what makes
--      the counters below safe to increment.
--
-- There are no foreign keys between these tables. They are fed by independent
-- streams and a payment can legitimately arrive before the company that paid
-- it has been projected.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- activity --

-- The raw event stream, and the audit feed served from it.
--
-- Written first in every consumer transaction: an INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO
-- NOTHING that affects zero rows means this event has already been applied, so
-- the rest of the transaction is skipped. That is what makes an increment
-- idempotent under redelivery without every payload needing a natural key.
