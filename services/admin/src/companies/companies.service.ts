/**
 * The tenant list and the single-tenant picture.
 *
 * Both are assembled entirely from this service's projections. The detail page
 * deliberately does NOT call companies, subscriptions or support to freshen
 * itself: a console page that fans out to four services is a page that is down
 * whenever any of them is, and the freshness it would buy is already bounded by
 * how fast events arrive. What the page does instead is report how far behind
 * the projection is, so an operator can tell a stale figure from a wrong one.
