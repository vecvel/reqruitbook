/**
 * The writes that keep the read model current.
 *
 * Every method takes the transaction client rather than the pool: a projection
 * update and the activity row that de-duplicates it must commit together or not
 * at all, or a crash between the two would let the same event be applied twice.
 *
 * Two patterns repeat and are worth reading once:
 *
 *   - `ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE ... WHERE EXCLUDED.occurred_at >= <table>.occurred_at`
 *     is the out-of-order guard. Postgres evaluates the WHERE after choosing to
 *     update, so a late event simply does nothing rather than resurrecting a
 *     state the tenant has already left. `>=` rather than `>` because two facts
 *     can share a millisecond, and a genuine redelivery has already been
 *     stopped by the activity gate.
 *
 *   - `COALESCE(NULLIF(EXCLUDED.<col>, ''), <table>.<col>)` keeps a partial
 *     event from blanking a field it simply did not carry. `company.suspended`
 *     says nothing about the company's name, and it must not erase it.
