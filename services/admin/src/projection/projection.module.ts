/**
 * Wires the consumer to the bus, and keeps the audit table from growing forever.
 *
 * The durable consumer is created here rather than in the consumer class so the
 * class stays a pure function of an envelope — which is what makes it testable
 * without NATS.
 *
 * Subscribing at module init means the service is consuming before it accepts
 * HTTP traffic. That ordering is deliberate: a console that answers requests
 * while its read model is still catching up shows an operator a figure that is
 * about to change under them, and JetStream's backlog means "catching up" can
 * be thousands of events after a deploy.
