/**
 * What this service connects to, and what reports on those connections.
 *
 * The pool and the configuration come from {@link DatabaseModule}; this module
 * adds the event bus — the only thing that ever *writes* to this database — and
 * the `/healthz` and `/readyz` endpoints an orchestrator probes.
 *
 * Note the distinction between those endpoints and `GET /v1/admin/health`. The
 * ones here answer "should this process receive traffic?" and are unauthenticated
 * because a probe carries no token. The admin one answers "is the platform
 * well?" for a human operator, and is behind a platform principal like every
 * other console route.
