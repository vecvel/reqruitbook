/**
 * The platform-wide audit feed.
 *
 * Every row here is an event this service consumed, kept because a read model
 * that cannot say *why* a figure changed is half a console. It is the same
 * table the projection consumer writes to first in each transaction, which is
 * what makes the projection idempotent — see the header of 001_admin.sql.
 *
 * The feed is strictly newest-first and paged by keyset on
 * `(occurred_at, event_id)`. Both indexes carry the event id as the tiebreaker
 * for that reason: two events can share a millisecond, and a cursor over
 * timestamp alone would either repeat or skip one of them.
