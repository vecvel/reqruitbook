/**
 * The operator's view of platform health.
 *
 * Distinct from `/healthz` and `/readyz`, which belong to the orchestrator and
 * are unauthenticated because a probe carries no token. This one is a console
 * page: platform staff only, and it reports on *other* services.
 *
 * It answers 200 even when everything it probed is down. The status code
 * describes this endpoint's own success — it did probe, and here is what it
 * found — and an operator tool that 503s during an outage is a tool that
 * disappears exactly when it is needed. The body carries the verdict.
 *
 * `platform_settings.read` is the permission. The registry has no "platform
 * health" key and a service may not invent one: an invented key can never be
 * granted to any role, so the route would be unreachable for everyone including
 * the superadmin. Viewing the platform's own operational state is the closest
 * thing the registry describes.
