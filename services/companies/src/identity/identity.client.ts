/**
 * Calls the identity service's internal provisioning API.

 * Identity owns accounts, roles and memberships; this service owns the company

 * whether the owner's email is already taken and whether the slug is free in its
 * own projection. It is asked synchronously — a registration that "succeeded"
 * but left the owner unable to sign in is worse than one that failed cleanly.
