   * The two writes cannot share a transaction — one is a network call — so the
   * flow is a saga with one compensation: if identity rejects the tenant, the
   * company row is deleted again. That is safe precisely because the row is
   * seconds old and nothing references it yet.
   *
   * The failure this cannot undo is a compensating delete that itself fails.
   * That leaves a `pending_review` row holding a slug with no tenant behind it;
   * it is logged with the company id and the slug so it can be cleared, and it
   * is strictly better than the opposite orphan — an identity tenant with
