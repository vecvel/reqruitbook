/**
 * Service-to-service lookups.

 * Other services hold a company id on their own rows and need a name and a logo

 *
 * `@Public()` marks these as outside the gateway's principal model — they are
 * never routed from the internet at all — and the internal-token guard is what
 * actually admits the caller. The response is a `CompanySummary` and nothing
 * more: an internal caller is still not entitled to the owner's email.
