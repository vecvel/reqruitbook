/**
 * SQL for the companies aggregate.
 *
 * Two rules hold everywhere in this file:
 *
 *  1. A company-scoped statement names the tenant in its WHERE clause. The
 *     tenant key of this table is its primary key, so `WHERE id = $1` *is* the
 *     tenant filter — but it is always written from the verified principal's
 *     company id, never from a path parameter.
 *  2. A soft-deleted row is invisible to everything except the platform
 *     endpoints that explicitly ask for it. `deleted_at IS NULL` is part of the
 *     predicate rather than something a caller remembers to add.
