-- Messaging service schema.
--
-- A conversation has two sides that are scoped by different things, and the
-- schema is shaped so neither filter can be forgotten:
--
--   * the company side is tenant-scoped — every statement a recruiter can reach
--     carries "AND company_id = $n"
--   * the candidate side is account-scoped — a candidate is not a tenant, and
--     their own account id is the only boundary that means anything on the jobs
--     portal, so those statements carry "AND candidate_account_id = $n"
--
-- Both predicates exist on `messages` as well as on `conversations`, denormalised
-- on purpose. A message query that joined up to the conversation to find its
-- tenant would be one missing JOIN condition away from a cross-tenant read; a
-- column on the row itself cannot be left out of a WHERE clause by accident.

CREATE TYPE message_sender_type AS ENUM ('company', 'candidate');

-- How a conversation came to exist. It drives the daily open limit (only the
-- company-initiated kinds are counted) and tells the UI why a thread appeared.
CREATE TYPE conversation_origin AS ENUM ('recruiter', 'approach', 'application');
