// mayOpenConversation decides whether a company may start a thread with a
// candidate who has not written to it first.
//
// It reports whether the candidate has applied as well as whether contact is
// allowed, because the caller needs the same fact to decide the conversation's
// origin: a thread labelled "application" skips the daily cap, so that label has
// to come from a row rather than from the request that asked for it.
//
// The rule has two branches and they are checked cheapest-first:
//
//  1. the candidate applied to one of this company's jobs — an application is
//     standing permission to be contacted about it, and the fact is already in
//     this service's projection, so the common case costs no network hop;
//  2. otherwise the candidate must be discoverable and must not have blocked
//     this company.
//
// Branch 2 is split across two sources, and not by choice. The candidates
// service owns both halves, but its internal profile endpoint exposes only
// `discoverable`; the per-company block list is not on it. So discoverability is
// asked of the authority on every request — it is a consent switch the candidate
// can flip at any moment and a stale copy would hold the door open after they
// closed it — while the block list is read from this service's projection of the
// visibility events, which carry `hideFromCompanies`.
//
// The gap is worth closing upstream: `GET /internal/candidates/{accountId}`
// should answer "may company X contact this person?" rather than leaving two
// services to assemble the answer from different sources.
