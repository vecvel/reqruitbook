/**
 * Subscription lifecycle.
 *
 * The gateway refuses every company route when a tenant has no live
 * entitlement, so what this service decides is literally whether a customer's
 * portal opens. Two rules are therefore enforced here rather than left to
 * callers:
 *
 *   - entitlements are snapshotted at purchase, so editing a plan never changes
 *     what an existing customer already bought;
 *   - a company has at most one live subscription, enforced by a partial unique
 *     index rather than a check, because two concurrent activations would both
 *     pass a read-then-write.
