// can write it: a request-driven design would leave an offer "sent" until
// somebody happened to look at it, and a list would show a live offer that ran
// out three weeks ago. Mutations do not wait for this worker — they compare the
// deadline themselves — so a sweep that is late costs accuracy in a listing and
// never correctness in a decision.
