-- Offers service schema.
--
-- This service owns the compensation package a company puts in front of a
-- candidate: what was offered, who signed it off, when it went out, and what
-- came back. The application and the candidate live in other services; what is
-- kept here is the offer itself plus the two snapshot fields an offers list
-- needs, so rendering a hundred offers does not fan out into a hundred calls.
--
-- Two decisions are encoded in the columns and are worth stating once:
--
--   * Money is bigint minor units plus a char(3) currency. A float cannot
--     represent 1234.05 exactly, and a salary that drifts by a cent between the
--     letter and the payroll export is a dispute, not a rounding artefact.
--   * The approval trail (submitted_by, approved_by, sent_by) is stored rather
--     than derived, because "who approved this package?" has to stay answerable
--     after the person leaves the company and their membership is gone.
