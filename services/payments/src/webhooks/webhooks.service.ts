/**
 * Settlement: the only path in this service that may declare money received.
 *
 * Three properties matter here and everything else is arrangement around them.
 *
 * 1. **The signature is checked against the raw bytes.** A body that has been
 *    parsed and re-serialised differs in key order and whitespace and will not
 *    verify. The signature is the entire security of a public route, so nothing
 *    below runs until `verifyWebhook` has returned.
 *
 * 2. **A repeat does nothing twice.** `webhook_events.provider_event_id` is
 *    UNIQUE and the claim is an INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING, so two
 *    concurrent deliveries of one event cannot both proceed. A second delivery
 *    answers 200 without re-applying — double-crediting a subscription is a real
 *    financial bug, not a cosmetic one.
 *
 * 3. **Everything answers 200 quickly, including what we ignore.** Providers
 *    retry on any non-2xx, so an unrecognised event type that returned 4xx would
 *    be redelivered forever. What was ignored, and why, is recorded on the row.
