/**
 * The provider callback route.
 *
 * It is `@Public()` because a payment provider has no session and never will:
 * the signature over the raw body is the entire authentication of this
 * endpoint, which is why `main.ts` keeps the raw bytes and why nothing here
 * touches a parsed body.
 *
 * It answers 200 for anything it understood, including events it deliberately
 * ignored, because a provider retries on any non-2xx. The only non-2xx it ever
 * returns is 401 for a signature that did not verify — and that answer carries
 * no hint as to why.
