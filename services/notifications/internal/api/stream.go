// handleStream pushes a recipient's notifications as they happen.
//
// Server-sent events rather than a WebSocket, for three reasons that all point
// the same way here. The traffic is one-way — the server tells the client that
// something happened and the client acts on it over the normal REST API — so
// the duplex channel a WebSocket buys would go unused. SSE is ordinary HTTP,
// which means it inherits the gateway's authentication, its tracing and its
// proxying unchanged, where a WebSocket needs an Upgrade path through every hop
// and its own way of carrying the principal. And EventSource reconnects by
// itself, with Last-Event-ID, so a laptop closing its lid costs nothing;
// reconnection logic is a thing we would otherwise have to write and get right.
//
// The durable copy is already in Postgres before anything is published here. A
// frame that is missed — a client between reconnects, a Redis blip — costs an
// animation, not a notification: the next list request has the row.
