// Package realtime carries a new notification from whichever replica created it
// to whichever replica is holding the recipient's open connection.
//
// Those are rarely the same process. An SSE stream is pinned to one instance
// for its whole life, while the consumer that produces the notification is
// wherever JetStream happened to deliver the event, so a purely in-process fan
// out would light up one replica's clients and silently miss the rest. Redis
// pub/sub is the smallest thing that closes that gap: it is fire-and-forget,
// which is exactly right here, because the durable copy is already in Postgres
// and a client that missed a live frame reloads its list.
