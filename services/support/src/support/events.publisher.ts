/**
 * Domain events, so notifications can fan out without this service knowing how
 * anyone is reached.
 *
 * Two deliberate omissions.
 *
 * No payload carries a message body. A notification pipeline ends in an email,
 * and an event on a 30-day retained stream is the wrong place for a customer's
 * account details; a consumer that needs the text calls back for it with the
 * caller's own permissions.
 *
 * Internal notes publish nothing at all. Marking the event `internal: true` and
 * trusting every present and future consumer to honour the flag is the same
 * mistake as filtering notes in a serializer — one naive consumer mails the note
 * to the customer. A note is desk bookkeeping, not a reply, so there is no fact
 * here for anyone outside the desk to react to.
