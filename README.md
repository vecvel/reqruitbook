# ReqruitBook

A multi-tenant recruitment platform. Companies get isolated careers portals,
candidates get one central job portal, and the platform is operated from a
separate administration console.

## Layout

```
apps/
  web-company/      A company's own recruiting portal — {slug}.{host}  (Next.js)
  web-jobs/         The candidate job portal — jobs.{host}             (Next.js)
  web-admin/        The platform administration console — root.{host}  (Next.js)
  web-landing/      Marketing, pricing and both sign-ups — {host}      (Next.js)

  support/          Support tickets, company and platform sides (NestJS)
  admin/            Root console aggregation over projections (NestJS)
packages/
  goshared/         Shared Go platform library
  nestshared/       Shared TypeScript platform library (the NestJS counterpart)
  ui/               Shared front-end layer: API client, access evaluator, transport
scripts/            dev.sh (run the stack), smoke.sh + smoke-product.sh (live suites)
deploy/             Infrastructure, service images, local orchestration
docs/               Architecture, service contract, front ends, RBAC
```

Both shared libraries expose the same concepts — problem+json, the gateway
principal, the permission guard, cursor pagination, the migration runner, the
event envelope — so a service behaves the same way whichever runtime it is
written in.

**No front end holds a database.** There is no connection string in any app,
and there is not meant to be one: a portal that could read a table could read
another tenant's rows, and the boundary that stops that lives at the gateway.

## Getting started

Requires Go 1.26+, Node 20+, pnpm, and Docker.

```bash
make setup      # signing keys, .env, and the infrastructure containers
make dev        # infrastructure, every service, and the company portal
```

`make dev` runs the backend and `web-company` on :3000. The other three portals
are separate Next servers you start yourself when you need them:

```bash
pnpm --filter @reqruitbook/web-jobs dev      # :3001
pnpm --filter @reqruitbook/web-admin dev     # :3002
pnpm --filter @reqruitbook/web-landing dev   # :3003
```

`make dev` discovers every service in the tree, builds it, and waits for its
readiness endpoint before starting the next. Three behaviours are deliberate:

- **A service that does not compile or start is skipped, loudly, by name.** One
  service still being written then costs you its own routes — which answer 502,
  exactly as a deployed-but-down service would — instead of the whole platform.
- **A port held by something `dev.sh` did not start is left alone**, and that
  service is skipped. Killing an unknown process would be worse than not
  starting one.
- **`make dev-down` sweeps those ports anyway.** Stopping is explicit intent, so
  it clears stale listeners a crash or a hand-started process left behind.
  Without that sweep the skip above quietly leaves an *old binary* serving while
  a fresh `make dev` reports success — a confusing way to lose an afternoon.

```bash
make status        # what is running, and on which port
make smoke-all     # both test suites against the running stack
make dev-down      # stop the services (infrastructure keeps running)
```

Two suites run against the live stack:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `make smoke` | Security boundaries: cross-tenant tokens, header spoofing, portal isolation, credential enumeration, refresh replay |
| `make smoke-product` | The product: post a job, publish it, apply, advance the pipeline, reject, discover talent, schedule a round, file scorecards, draft an offer, read the audit trail |

Migrations run automatically at service boot, so `make migrate` is only needed
to apply them without starting anything. It depends on `make db`, which creates
any service database a running Postgres is missing — the container's init script
only runs on a fresh volume, so a service added later would otherwise fail to
start with an error that says nothing about the cause.

To run the services by hand instead, in separate terminals:

```bash
make run-identity   # :8081
make run-gateway    # :8080
```

### First sign-in

`make setup` writes bootstrap credentials into `.env`. The identity service
creates that administrator on first boot and logs a warning; sign in, change the
password, then remove the `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_*` lines.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Host: root.reqruitbook.local' \
  -d '{"realm":"platform","email":"admin@reqruitbook.local","password":"..."}'
```

### Local hostnames

Portals are routed by hostname. For browser testing, add them to `/etc/hosts`:

```
127.0.0.1  reqruitbook.local root.reqruitbook.local jobs.reqruitbook.local acme.reqruitbook.local
```

With `curl`, a `Host:` header is enough. `web-company` does not need the hosts
entry at all: reached at `localhost:3000` its hostname carries no slug, so
`COMPANY_SLUG` in its `.env` says which company the dev server is the portal
for.

Append the line as its own line. Adding it to the end of an existing one —
which is what `echo ... >> /etc/hosts` does when the file has no trailing
newline — makes the whole line a comment, and nothing resolves.
