/**
 * The server-side transport every portal uses to reach the gateway.
 *
 * It exists because of one fact about Node: `fetch` (undici) implements the
 * WHATWG forbidden-header list, and `Host` is on it. A `Host` header set on a
 * fetch is silently dropped and replaced with the URL's authority — no error,
 * no warning. The gateway resolves the portal, and therefore which routes exist
 * at all, from that header, so every server-side call made with fetch arrived
 * claiming to be `localhost:8080`, resolved the public portal, and was answered
 * 404 for every route the portal actually needed.
 *
 * That failure is close to invisible from the outside. The 404 is indis-
 * tinguishable from an endpoint that does not exist yet, and a portal whose
 * reads are wrapped in "return an empty list on failure" simply renders empty
 * screens: a dashboard of zeros, a roster with nobody on it, a settings page
 * with no roles. Three of the four portals shipped that way.
 *
 * `node:http` sends the header as written. GATEWAY_URL stays a connection
 * address — 127.0.0.1:8080 in development, the cluster service in production —
 * while the portal host stays the identity the gateway routes on. They are
 * genuinely different things, and keeping them separate is what lets a portal
 * be reached over localhost while still being addressed as itself.
 *
 * This module is Node-only. It is exported from `@reqruitbook/ui/server` rather
 * than the package root so a browser bundle can never pull `node:http` in.
