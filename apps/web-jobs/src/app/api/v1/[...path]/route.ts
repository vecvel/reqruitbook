/**
 * A same-origin pass-through to the gateway, and the only way the browser
 * reaches it.
 *
 * Two problems it solves at once. The gateway decides which portal a request
 * belongs to from the Host header, and a browser calling
 * `http://localhost:8080` directly would announce `Host: localhost:8080`, which
 * names no portal — so the candidate routes would not exist. And a direct call
 * would be cross-origin, so it would need CORS and could not carry the
 * same-origin cookies this app relies on.
 *
 * Mounting it at `/api/v1/*` means client code calls the paths the service
 * contract documents — `/api/v1/me`, `/api/v1/my-applications` — with no
 * rewriting at the call site and no second spelling to keep in step.
 *
 * This handler adds no authority of its own. It forwards the caller's own
 * Authorization header and nothing else; the gateway strips every trust header
 * a client sends before setting its own, so nothing here can assert an
 * identity even by accident.
