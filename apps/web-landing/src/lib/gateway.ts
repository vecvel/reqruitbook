 * The only way this app reaches data.
 *
 * `packages/ui`'s ApiClient is built around a session — an access token in
 * memory and a refresh route to renew it. This portal has neither: every
 * endpoint it touches is public by route at the gateway. So it uses the shared
 * ProblemError, which is the part that has to be identical across portals, and
 * a much smaller fetch around it.
 *
 * Server-side only, deliberately. A browser cannot set a Host header, so a
 * fetch straight from the page would arrive at the gateway as whatever origin
 * the tab is on and be resolved to the wrong portal — or, in development, be
 * refused by CORS before it ever got that far.

 * and Node's fetch silently drops it: every call from here arrived as
 * `localhost:8080`, resolving a portal this site is not.
 *
 * `revalidate` is accepted but no longer caches: Next's fetch cache only covers
 * `fetch`. The pricing page reads the plan catalogue on each render instead,
