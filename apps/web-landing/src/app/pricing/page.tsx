          <Faq q="What happens when a subscription lapses?">
            Your portal closes to new activity and your team is signed out — the
            entitlement is checked on every request, not once a night. Your data is
            not deleted, and the billing pages stay reachable so you can put it right.
          </Faq>
          <Faq q="Do candidates pay?">
            No. A candidate account, a profile, a résumé and applying to jobs are free.
            Plans on this page are for companies.
          </Faq>
          <Faq q="What does a limit of zero mean?">
            Exactly that: the feature is not part of that plan. A limit shown as
            unlimited has no cap at all. We do not use “unlimited” to mean “a lot”.
          </Faq>
          <Faq q="Can I change plan later?">
            Yes, from the billing section of your own portal once you are signed in.
