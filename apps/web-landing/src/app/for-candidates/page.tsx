            Your details and your résumé belong to your account, not to a company&rsquo;s
            database. Apply to a job on the network or on a company&rsquo;s own careers
            page — it is the same account either way, and you do not retype anything.
          </Block>

          <Block title="You control whether you can be found">
            Recruiters can search candidate profiles, but only those who have turned
            discoverability on. It is off until you say otherwise, and turning it off
            again removes you from their results.
          </Block>

          <Block title="Apply once, then watch it move">
            One application per job — no accidental duplicates. You can see which stage
            each application has reached, and you are told when it changes.
          </Block>

          <Block title="Talk to the recruiter">
            Messages from a company arrive in your account, attached to the job they are
            about, and you can reply there. Nothing goes through a personal inbox unless
            you want the email notification.
          </Block>

          <Block title="A separate identity from your work account">
            If you also recruit for a company on ReqruitBook, the two accounts can share
            an email address and stay completely separate. Leaving that employer does not
            touch your candidate account.
          </Block>

          <Block title="Leaving is a button">
            You can delete your candidate profile. Applications you have already sent are
            a record the company holds, and the platform will not pretend otherwise.
