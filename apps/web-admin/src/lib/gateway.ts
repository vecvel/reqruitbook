 * The only place in this app that knows where the gateway lives.
 *
 * Every call carries `Host: PORTAL_HOST`. The gateway resolves the portal from
 * the Host header and answers 404 for a platform route that did not arrive on
 * root.{hostname} — so the portal is established by where the request lands,
 * never by a field the client sets.
 *
 * The transport lives in `@reqruitbook/ui/server` now. It was written here
 * first, because this console was the app that noticed Node's `fetch` silently
 * drops a `Host` header; the other three portals were still using `fetch` and
 * had been resolving the wrong portal for every server-side call. Sharing one
 * implementation is what stops that from being rediscovered a fourth time.
