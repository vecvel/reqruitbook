/**
 * Applying from a company's careers page.
 *
 * This used to accept an anonymous submission and write a candidate row
 * directly. The platform does not work that way, and for a defensible reason:
 * an application belongs to a candidate's account, so the candidate can see it,
 * withdraw it and be messaged about it from their own portal. One application
 * per candidate per job is enforceable only because there is an account to key
 * it on.
 *
 * `POST /api/v1/public/apply` is therefore public by *route* but requires a
 * candidate principal — an unauthenticated POST is answered 401. There is no
 * endpoint that accepts an anonymous application, and inventing one here would
 * mean writing a record no service owns.
 *
 * So the careers page collects nothing and sends the visitor to the candidate
 * portal to sign in or register, carrying the job they were looking at.
