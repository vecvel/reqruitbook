/**
 * The company portal's one way of reaching its data.
 *
 * Everything the app knows now comes from here. There is no database client in
 * this app, and a feature that wants a record asks the gateway for it — which
 * is what makes the tenant check, the permission check and the subscription
 * check real rather than advisory.
 *
 * Calls go through `gatewayRequest` rather than `fetch`. The gateway decides
 * which portal — and therefore which routes exist — from the Host header, and
 * Node's fetch silently drops that header: every call from here used to arrive
 * claiming to be `localhost:8080`, resolve the public portal, and come back 404.
 * Because the reads below fall back to an empty value, that showed up as a
 * dashboard of zeros rather than as an error.
